### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto and am mainly focused on computer software, while pursing a minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering.
My experience includes building, shipping and scaling mobile apps for both Android and IOS. 
I have worked with both low level and high level languages while doing backend and frontend work.
